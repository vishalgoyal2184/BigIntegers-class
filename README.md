## BigIntegers-class
BigIntegersðŸš€ is a C++ library that is useful when we are dealing with BigIntegersðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥. 
This is a Big Integer Class, implemented in C++,__for handling very large numbers__, or numbers greater than unsigned long long int in a 64 bit implementation. So, it can __easily operate on numbers greater than 10^18__.It is capable of performin __Arithematic operations__ like addition,subtraction etc., _Finding factorial_ and performing functions like finding _minimum and maximum and absolute value_.

## Features
  #### A) Arithematic Operations
  1. Addition
  2. Subtraction
  3. Multiplication 
  4. Division
#### B) Increment/Decrement 
  1. Post Increment
  2. Post Decrement
  3. Pre Increment 
  4. Pre Decrement
#### C) Factorial
#### D) Maximum, Minimum and Absolute Functions
